# Replacing redux with react hooks and context
This is a project which shows off how to use hooks and context to replace Redux.


If you’ve been in the React world for a decent amount of time you would have heard about Redux. Redux is cool, it’s a way of getting separate components to alter and pull data from the main application store, but it’s not easy to pick up, especially for beginners.

With the introduction of the Context API and hooks, we can sort of recreate Redux in our React app without actually installing redux and react-redux.
